            <h2 class="main-title-large center">How it all started...</h2>
            <p>It all started when I thought computers were just for games and movies—until one day, curiosity won. I clicked, explored, broke a few things (okay, many things), and somehow enjoyed fixing them more than using them.</p>
            <p class="italic">- I learned that “trial and error” is just a fancy way of saying try again..</p>
            <p>LAlong the way, I realized that every mistake teaches something new. From small bugs to big challenges, each experience pushed me to learn more, laugh at my errors, and keep going—because progress starts when you don’t give up.

                    I plan to continue improving my skills by attending IT-related courses and learning from both school and reputable online platforms. These courses help me strengthen my foundation in programming, web design, and system development while keeping up with new technologies.

                    Currently, I am working on two ongoing projects. One project focuses on building a web-based system that improves user interaction and design, while the other involves developing a simple application that applies core programming concepts such as logic, data handling, and problem-solving. Both projects help me apply what I learn in real-world scenarios.

                    One achievement I am proud of is completing projects that started as simple ideas and slowly turned into functional systems. Through these experiences, I have learned important concepts such as clean code, consistency in design, debugging, and the value of patience in development.

Being with my dog teaches me patience, responsibility, and the importance of enjoying the present moment. No matter how busy things get, this time reminds me to slow down and appreciate the little joys in life.</p>

                <p>Coding is where I turn ideas into something real. I enjoy learning how different lines of code work together to solve problems and create useful applications.
Through coding, I’ve learned patience, logical thinking, and the importance of testing and improving my work. Every challenge helps me grow, and every bug fixed feels like a small win.</p>

                <p>I sometimes enjoy doing random and unusual things—like overthinking simple problems, experimenting with ideas that may or may not work, and finding fun in things others might find strange.
These “weird” moments spark creativity and curiosity. They remind me that thinking differently isn’t a weakness—it’s often where the best ideas begin.</p>
